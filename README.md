## 🧭 The Vibe Coding Approach

Rather than writing code from scratch, this project was built by guiding AI through clear, intuitive prompts — letting the tools handle the mechanics while focusing on **intent and outcome**.

**Tools used:**
- 🧠 **Codex / ChatGPT (Teams)** — to generate, review, and refine code
- 🔧 **GitHub** — to version, edit, and commit changes
- 🌐 **GitHub Pages** — to host and deploy the app publicly

### Example Prompts Used:
- `Create an HTML and JavaScript calculator that converts numeric scores (0–100) into letter grades.`
- `Add a reset button that clears the input field and grade output.`
- `Add styling to center the layout and improve readability.`
